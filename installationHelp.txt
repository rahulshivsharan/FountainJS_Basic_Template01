The initial project-template was creating using below link

Pre-requisit 

Node should be installed

Follow commands below

1. npm install

2. For Bower installation on windows

   "npm bower install" doesn't work
    hence followed the below link
    and fired the command

    "npm install node-gyp@latest"

     npm install -g bower

3.   bower install 

     if you get some error like 'Could not lead Visual C++ component VCBuild.exe' than follow the link stackoverflow link and do the command as shown below link
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21658832/npm-install-error-msb3428-could-not-load-the-visual-c-component-vcbuild-ex
	 
	 
	 "npm install --global --production windows-build-tools"


NOTE:
I was facing to run command 'gulp serve' hence run the below command
"npm i -g gulp-cli"


Note : There is an issue.
When we do "gulp build", all user created scripts are merged and compressed to "app-someRandomString.js" and all the js libraries are merged and compressed to
"vendor-someRandomString.js", these generated scripts gets referred in index.html on the fly. Sometimes "gulp build" command generates multiple scripts
and out of which only few gets referred in index.html, hence the build version of our application fails when build is deployed on server.
Hence to avoid this, after doing "gulp build" please refer that all the scripts are getting referred in index.html, if not, include those manually.
